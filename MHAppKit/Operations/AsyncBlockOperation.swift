 A simple asynchronous operation that executes a given block.
 
 - warning: You must call the provided completion block once the execution of the given block finishes in order to release the lock. If you do not do that, the operation will stall.
 - note: This is a synchronous operation that mimic asynchronous execution, by locking its thread by using a semapthore during the block execution.
